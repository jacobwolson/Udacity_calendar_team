# What is the next tech event in Seattle?

This is a website that provides information on local Tech Events.

<!-- I think we can add these parts once the database is done. -->

## Motivation

A group of scholars in the 2018 Grow with Google Scholarship: Front-End Web Development program came together to work on a group project as an opportunity to test out their coding skills. The only way to become better at something is to practice, practice, and practice some more! The project was also aimed to help the participants gain experience collaborating with others using tools such as Github and Git version control.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them


You will need to install a text editor of your choice in order to make changes to the code on your local machine. Here is a few popular text editors.

<li>Sublime Text
https://www.sublimetext.com/</li>

<li>Atom
https://atom.io/</li>

<li>Visual Studio Code
https://code.visualstudio.com/</li>

You may also want to use a variable of Git for version control. You will likely make various changes to your code and will want to store different versions to experiment with.

<li>Git
https://git-scm.com/</li>

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why
